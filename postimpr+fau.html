            <h3 class="origin">Origin:</h3>
            <p>Fauvism was built on Post-Impressionism. It originated in the early 20th century.</p>
            <h3 class="ideas">Ideas & Characteristics:</h3>
            <p>As it is a movement build on Post-Impressionism, it shares similarities like expressive lines. However, there are several new characteristics that include vivid and unmixed colour and bold approach (e.g.: sky could be orange). Fauvism aimed at conveying emotions through colour and form rather than with a realistic representation of reality.</p>
            <h3 class="artist">Artists:</h3>
            <p>Example of a Fauvist artist is Henri Matisse.</p>
