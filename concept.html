        <h3 class="origin">Origin:</h3>
        <p>Conceptual art began in the mid 1960s. It marked a radical departure from traditional forms of art. It questioned the traditional forms of art and pushed their boundaries. It prioritizes ideas and concepts over aesthetics.</p>
        <h3 class="ideas">Ideas & Characteristics:</h3>
        <p>It expanded on the ideas of its predecessors. For example, like Cubistic art, it put a large emphasis on the viewers perception of the art piece. It was idea-centric, meaning that it focused on the conceptual or intellectual aspect of the artwork often considering the idea behind the work as more important than its aesthetic representation. It introduced new kinds of interdisciplinary approaches to the art, such as the inclusion of language, performance, everyday objects and other divers media. This movement also implemented dematerialization which was challenging the traditional tangibility and physicality of the artwork.</p>
        <h3 class="artist">Artists:</h3>
        <p>Artists include  Sol LeWitt, Yoko Ono or Joseph Beuys.</p>
